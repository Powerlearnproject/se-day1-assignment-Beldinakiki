Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of software. It is important as it ensures real world problems are solved by creating realiable and efficient technological solutions.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- The development of programming languages, the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements - Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
- Design - Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
- Implementation - Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
- Testing - Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
- Deployment - Releasing the software to users or customers.
- Maintenance - Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall uses a sequential approach with distinct phases while Agile uses a iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. Waterfall would be used when developing software where there is a strict timeline and budget with set requirements while Agile would be used where there is a more than one developer working on a project.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer - They build the system by writting code that meets the requirements specified.
- Quality Assuarance Engineer - They make sure that the software being developed meets the standards and specifed functional and non-functional requirements.
- Project Manager - They plan, organize, and manage the project to ensure it's delivered on time, within budget, and meets the project goals.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- IDEs -Provide an easy to use environment for developers to write code. An example is Visual Studio Code
- Version Control Systems - Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. An example is Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Getting challenging errors. - Learning to debugging skills and using platforms such as stackoverflow.
- Lack of skills especially when new technology/ Langauges. - frequently Upskilling and learning new languages.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-  Unit Testing - Unit testing focuses on testing the smallest testable parts of an application, called units.A unit can be a function, method, or class. 
-  Integration Testing -  Integration testing verifies that different units or components of the application work together correctly. It focuses on the interactions between modules, ensuring that data is passed correctly and that the integrated components function as a whole.
-  System Testing - System testing evaluates the entire system as a whole. It verifies that the system meets the requirements and functions as expected in a real-world environment.
-  Acceptance Testing - Acceptance testing is performed by the end-users or clients to determine whether the system meets their business needs and is acceptable for release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 - Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
 - Prompt engineering helps avoid that by making your questions clear and specific, so that the AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
 - Give me a cake recipe.
 - Give me a chocolate cake recipe that feeds 3 people. This is an improved prompt that is clear and specific in that it highlights that it is a chocolate cake and for three people.
