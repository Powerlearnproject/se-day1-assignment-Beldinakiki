Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of software. It is important as it ensures real world problems are solved by creating realiable and efficient technological solutions.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages, the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
 Waterfall uses a sequential approach with distinct phases while Agile uses a iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. Waterfall would be used when developing software where there is a strict timeline and budget while Agile would be used where there is a more than one developer working on a project.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs -Provide an easy to use environment for developers to write code. An example is Visual Studio Code
Version Control Systems - Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. An example is Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Getting challenging errors. - Learning to debugging skills and using platforms such as stackoverflow.
- Lack of skills especially when new technology/ Langauges. - frequently Upskilling and learning new languages.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
